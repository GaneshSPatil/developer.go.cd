##  5.11 Backup

Post version 12.1.0 GoCD supports one click backup through the administration interface as well as through the API. The backup is performed into the `{ARTIFACT_REPOSITORY_LOCATION}/serverBackups` directory. More details about this feature can be found [here](https://docs.gocd.org/current/advanced_usage/one_click_backup.html).

Backup is performed in mutual exclusion. Both the admin interface and the API call `startBackup` method of `BackupService.java`. The backup procedure starts with backing up the server version and config. Cipher file is backed up to ensure all the encryted passwords in the config work. GoCD maintains a git repository of the config file which is backed up next follwed by db backup. As of now, GoCD supports db backup only for [H2](http://www.h2database.com/html/main.html) database. Once the backup is completed a mail is sent and the mutex is released.
